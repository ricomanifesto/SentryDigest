Consistent with previous campaigns, the threat cluster leveraged UNC1543 distribution channels, involving search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and FAKEUPDATES, to deliver the COLORFAKE.V2 in-memory dropper and MYTHIC payloads. Additional UNC2165 campaigns were observed starting in late March and continuing into April. In all but one instance, UNC1543 FAKEUPDATES infections were confirmed leading to UNC2165 activity.  In almost all cases, the actors established persistence by creating a scheduled task, which executes a Python script to establish a remote connection to a C&C. Shortly following compromise, actors used Windows built-in operating system utilities to perform network reconnaissance activities. In at least one incident, the actors were observed using RDP to move laterally and install additional payloads such as COLORFAKE.V2. In several cases, UNC2165 enumerated the local Chrome and Microsoft Edge login data alongside the encryption keys from the state files. This allows the actors to decrypt passwords stored in Chrome and Microsoft Edge. In some of the incidents, the group leveraged FAKEUPDATES to execute PowerShell commands to replace HTML body tags within victims' Outlook signatures with a link to a remote resource used to harvest NT LAN Manager (NTLM) login information. In at least one case, PowerShell commands were used to create .LNK files, which, when executed, download a remote payload via the file’s icon. While no significant follow-on activity was observed, the incidents are believed to be financially motivated based on previous UNC2165 activity.">
