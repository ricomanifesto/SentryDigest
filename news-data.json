    "summary": "Date: 2025-09-23 • Beginning in December 2023, UNC2165 resumed their intrusion operations after a period of dormancy dating back to April 2023. Consistent with previous campaigns, the threat cluster leveraged UNC1543 distribution channels, involving search engine optimization (SEO) poisoning and FAKEUPDATES, to deliver the COLORFAKE.V2 in-memory dropper and MYTHIC payloads. Additional UNC2165 campaigns were observed starting in late March and continuing into April. In all but one instance, UNC1543 FAKEUPDATES infections were confirmed leading to UNC2165 activity.  In almost all cases, the actors established persistence by creating a scheduled task, which executes a Python script to establish a remote connection to a C&C. Shortly following compromise, actors used Windows built-in operating system utilities to perform network reconnaissance activities. In at least one incident, the actors were observed using RDP to move laterally and install additional payloads such as COLORFAKE.V2. In several cases, UNC2165 enumerated the local Chrome and Microsoft Edge login data alongside the encryption keys from the state files. This allows the actors to decrypt passwords stored in Chrome and Microsoft Edge. In some of the incidents, the group leveraged FAKEUPDATES to execute PowerShell commands to replace HTML body tags within victims' Outlook signatures with a link to a remote resource used to harvest NT LAN Manager (NTLM) login information. In at least one case, PowerShell commands were used to create .LNK files, which, when executed, download a remote payload via the file’s icon. While no significant follow-on activity was observed, the incidents are believed to be financially motivated based on previous UNC2165 activity.",

    "summary": "Date: 2025-09-18 • Since April 2024, UNC5518 has been distributing FAKETREFF, a JavaScript downloader that displays a fake error message urging users to take action. UNC5518 has evolved their techniques over time, including the introduction of obfuscation, multi-stage scripts leading to FAKETREFF, and the use of the ClickFix social engineering technique. UNC5518 FAKETREFF campaigns throughout 2024 and 2025 have led to a variety of additional malware, including QUICKBIND, NETSUPPORT, BANANACOOKIE, CLEANBOOST, CORNFLAKE, DARKGATE, and VOLTMARKER. UNC5518 campaigns appear to be fairly opportunistic, impacting a wide range of industry verticals and geographic regions.",

FIN6 has targeted corporate recruiters using job sites including LinkedIn and Indeed, directing victims to download an archive containing a BULLZLINK downloader hosted on actor-controlled domains. Domains and the file names of BULLZLINK samples associated with this activity have both incorporated common first and last names, presumably related to the personas being used to contact their targets. Other campaign elements such as website URLs and zip file names have also been tailored in a way to suggest customization to the specific jobs roles they may be using as a pretense for engagement.\\n\\n \\n\\nHistorical FIN6 campaigns have shared numerous technical and operational overlaps with this most recent activity, and have commonly leveraged job-themed files hosted on domains that appear to be fake personal websites or fake job boards. Malicious files delivered through these sites have consistently been BULLZLINK leading to SQUIDSLEEP and SQUIDGATE.",
